# Supermarket SQL Project

## Overview
This SQL project is designed to analyze sales data from a supermarket database. It includes data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements to create tables, import data, and perform various analytical queries.

## DDL (Data Definition Language)
This section contains SQL statements to create tables for storing information about aisles, departments, products, orders, and order products.

## DML (Data Manipulation Language)
This section includes SQL statements to import data into the tables created earlier. It also includes some data cleanup operations and adjustments.

## Analysis Queries
This section presents several SQL queries that analyze the sales data to answer specific business questions. These queries include:
- Top 10 Products Sales For Each Day of the Week
- 5 Most Popular Products in Each Aisle from Monday to Friday
- Top 10 Products with the Most Frequent Reorder Rate
- Shopperâ€™s Aisle List for Each Order
- Most Popular Shopping Path
- Top Pairwise Associations in Products

## How to Use
1. Execute the DDL statements to create the necessary tables in your SQL database.
2. Import the provided data files into the corresponding tables using the DML statements.
3. Run the analysis queries to gain insights into the supermarket sales data.

## Important Notes
- Make sure to adjust file paths in the LOAD DATA INFILE statements to match your environment.
- Review and understand each query before executing it against your database.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform DDL and DML operations in your SQL environment.

## Conclusion

These SQL queries provided valuable insights into various aspects of supermarket operations, including sales trends, customer behavior, and product associations. The results can be used to optimize inventory management, store layout, and marketing strategies to improve overall performance and customer satisfaction.
